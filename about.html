        <h3 class="abt"> Our Journey from the Past to the Present </h3>
          <p class="abtp">Over time, the 3 original classes of about 35 kids has gained the interest of many others. They have grown to 2 classes of Criminal Justice I, 2 classes of Criminal Justice II, 2 classes of Criminal Justice III, 1 Criminal Law class, and 1 Hunter Safety class. As all classes are eligible for joining the club, membership is estimated to be around 175 students a year.</p>
          <p class="abtp">The club itself has no real requirements or strict rules. The aim is to be an opportunity for more students to become involved. Not everyone can go into the medical field, work on cars, become an engineer, program computers, etc. As a result, the Criminal Justice Club is meant to show the other opportunities in careers. The world always needs extra hands in local, state, and federal law enforcement as well as corrections, law, and any other possible avenues, and the club does its best to highlight that.</p>
          <p class="abtp">Another goal of the Criminal Justice club is to give back to the community. Law enforcement officers are always putting their lives on the line, so any little action is a big help. It's nothing much, but it allows students to be a part of something while doing a good deed for others. Around Christmas, everyone gathers and puts together a gift basket for the local law enforcement offices. The basket contains things such as hand warmers, hot chocolate mix, packs of peanuts and crackers, and anything else that officers can walk in, grab, and go.</p>
