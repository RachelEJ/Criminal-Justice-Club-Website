# Criminal-Justice-Website

The Website

  My website was made for the Criminal Justice Club at Chester County High School because a website does not currently exist for it. The club is meant for the Criminal Justice classes of 1, 2, 3, as well as a Criminal Law class. The club offers a few community service projects. For example, the club makes a gift basket annually for the local law enforcement offices. The website is targeted at potential and current members to inform about the club and classes. Several pictures are to be included in the website in a photo gallery to show snapshots of a few events the club has participated in. The club, however, has no guidelines, logos, or real colors to incorporate in the website other than blue to symbolize law enforcement. Being rather limited, the club also has no social media accounts to link to aside from the occasional Facebook post. 
  
The Design Process
  
  The design process for the website didn't entirely go as planned. I had no real instructions as to how to design the website due to the vagueness of my client. As result, most decisions regarding the website's structure was left in my hands making that the hardest part of the whole process. It took a few days to figure out how the website would look, but once I started, it became a lot easier to go from there. Deciding how to make the website responsive was another issue, but it didn't meet the challenge that came with the initial design. 
 
Why I Chose Criminal Justce
  
  The reason why I chose the Criminal Justice Club is because I am a part of the club, and I realized that information is extremely limited, being available only through hearing it from the club's sponsor and other people who had the chance to hear him. I believe that there needed to be another way for people to find out more about it because not everyone has the opportunity to meet with the sponsor due to the fact that he still has to teach several classes. Making a website for the club will allow a larger group to hear about the club's news and information with more convenience and efficiency.
  
My Thoughts
  
  In general, the process of building a website from nothing is a new experience for me. It was interesting, had it's ups and downs, but overall it was pretty fun. I've always enjoyed trying something new, and this contest has certainly been a challenge for me and my classmates.
